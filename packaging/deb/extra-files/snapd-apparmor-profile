# Ubuntu Snap AppArmor profile additions by Snoopy Command Logger
#
# Snoopy installation from .deb currently does not reload apparmor profiles.
# You will either need to do that manually, or reboot the whole system.
#
# Additionally, once "inside" snap, Snoopy is unable to read /etc/snoopy.ini
# on the host's filesystem, which makes it revert back to the built-in default
# configuration.
